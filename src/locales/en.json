    "faq1_q": "What is SMART STUDENT and what is its main objective?",
    "faq1_a": "SMART STUDENT is an intelligent educational platform that uses Artificial Intelligence to enhance learning for Chilean students. Its objective is to facilitate studying through innovative tools like AI-generated summaries, mind maps, quizzes, and evaluations based on real academic content.",
    "faq2_q": "What are the main features offered by the platform?",
    "faq2_a": "The platform offers five main tools: 1) Digital Library with academic books, 2) AI Summary Generator, 3) Interactive Mind Map Creator, 4) Study Quiz Generator, and 5) Dynamic Evaluation System. All are powered by Artificial Intelligence and available in Spanish and English.",
    "faq3_q": "How does the intelligent evaluation system work?",
    "faq3_a": "Evaluations are dynamically generated by AI based on real content from academic PDFs. They include three types of questions: true/false, multiple choice, and multiple selection with several correct answers. Each evaluation is unique and adapts to the specific topic you're studying.",
    "faq4_q": "What educational levels is the platform designed for?",
    "faq4_a": "SMART STUDENT is designed for students in the Chilean educational system, from 1st Grade to 12th Grade (Senior Year). It includes curricular content aligned with official subjects like Mathematics, Sciences, History, Language, and specialized high school subjects.",
    "faq5_q": "How are summaries and mind maps generated?",
    "faq5_a": "Summaries are created using advanced AI that analyzes academic book content and the specific topic you need to study. Mind maps visualize connections between concepts, organizing information hierarchically and structurally to facilitate understanding and memorization.",
    "faq6_q": "Does the platform save my progress and study history?",
    "faq6_a": "Yes, SMART STUDENT automatically records your progress including: completed evaluations, scores obtained, generated summaries, created mind maps, and completed quizzes. You can view detailed statistics by subject and download your academic history in Excel format.",
    "faq7_q": "How does the platform ensure quality and variety of generated content?",
    "faq7_a": "The platform uses advanced AI algorithms that process real content from official academic books in the Chilean curriculum. Each generation includes randomness elements to ensure unique and varied content, avoiding repetitions while maintaining high educational quality.",
    "faq8_q": "Can I use SMART STUDENT without an internet connection?",
    "faq8_a": "SMART STUDENT requires an internet connection for AI tools to function (generating summaries, maps, evaluations). However, once content is generated, you can download it as PDF to study offline. History and progress are saved locally on your device.",
